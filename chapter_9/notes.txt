-> I noticed while coding an example of pointer concept that nothing is printing while trying to print address of a character. (ref. "printAdd.cpp"), but it "works for other data types".

->"/tmp/ccRBZ5fn.o: In function `main':
   9_17.cpp:(.text+0x146): undefined reference to `exchangePP(int*, int*)'
   collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status"

        This error will happen when function not defined correctly.
